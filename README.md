## Introduction

**Twisted Turns** is an infinite racing game that offers a unique twist on the classic endless runner genre. Instead of controlling a character, you're in charge of a car that moves along a dynamically generated zig-zag pathway. Your goal is to collect as many diamonds as possible while staying on the path. The game features random runtime path generation, ensuring that each playthrough is a new challenge.

## Gameplay

As a player, your objective is simple: control the car's movement and collect diamonds to achieve the highest possible score. The car's default speed will keep it moving along the pathway, and your job is to guide it through the twists and turns. The game's pathway is generated continuously based on an object pooling system, providing a seamless and ever-changing experience.

## Controls

Controlling the car is straightforward:

- **PC:** Click the left mouse button to make the car turn left or right.
- **Android:** Tap the screen to make the car turn left or right.

## Scoring

Your score will automatically update as you progress through the game. The primary way to increase your score is by collecting diamonds that appear along the pathway. Each diamond you collect adds a certain value to your overall score, providing a scoring bonus that encourages skilled navigation.
